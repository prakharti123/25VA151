      <p>
        <big>
          We are dreaming of tomorrow<br />
          and tomorrow isn't coming<br />
          We are dreaming of a glory that<br />
          we don't really want<br />
          We are dreaming of a new day<br />
          when the new day's here already<br />
          We are running from the battle<br />
          when it's one that must be fought.</big

      </p>

      <p><big> And still we sleep.</big></p>

      <p>
        <big>
          We are listening for the calling<br />
          but never really heeding<br />
          Hoping for the future when the<br />
          future's only plans<br />
          Dreaming of the wisdom that we<br />
          are dodging daily<br />
          Praying for a savoir when<br />
          salvation's in our hands.   </p>
      <p>And still we sleep.</p>

      <p>
        And still we sleep<br />
        And still we pray<br />
        And still we fear<br />
        And still we sleep.
